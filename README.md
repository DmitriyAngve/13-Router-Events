# 13-Router-Events

Small application with authentication. We are able to create user and log in - user interface reflects that. 
We're able to work with the different features of this application, like: adding new event, deleting event or editing event. This features be able if user log in.
Additionally added auto logout timer.
In addition, we protect certain routes (so you can't reach routes we're not supposed to reach)

All these features are implemented using a token that is created on the backend and sent to the frontend, stored in localStorage.
