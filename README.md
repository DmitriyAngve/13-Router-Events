# 13-starting-project

Small application with authentication. We are able to create user and log in - user interface reflects that. 
We're able to work with the different features of this application, like: adding new event, deleting event or editing event. This features be able if user log in.
I have auto logout timer.
In addition, we protect certain routes (so you can't reach routes we're not supposed to reach)

All these features are implemented using a token that is created on the backend and sent to the frontend, stored in localStorage.
